# My Mac LLAMA App

## Overview

My Mac LLAMA App is a menu bar application for macOS that integrates directly into your system's top bar. 
It's an app I made for myself to easily chat with Ollama, LLAMA 3, without opening the terminal everytime.
It's designed for quick access and instant feedback, making it a convenient tool for real-time text processing.

Best of all. Everything's local.


## Features

- **Menu Bar Integration:** Runs quietly in the menu bar, allowing for constant availability without obstructing desktop space.
- **Real-Time Text Interaction:** Send text prompts and receive responses from a configured API, all within a few clicks.
- **Simple UI:** A minimalistic user interface that focuses on functionality and ease of use.
